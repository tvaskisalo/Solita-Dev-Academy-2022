# Day 2

## What did I accomplish? 

This day I managed to continue the technology descriptions, add basic structure to backend and frontend, install dependencies and start working on the backend. I got mongoDB and first requests working. 

## What went well?

Explanations on technology choices went well. I think I explained my decisions well and they were justified. Frontend and backend structure planning was also successful in my opinion, it cleared a lot how the application will be structured and what needs to be done.

## What went poorly?

I had strugles with async/await with TypeScript, I have not previously used async/await with TypeScript and it caught me offguard, but I got it working, fortunately.

## Reflection

TypeScript has proven to be more time consuming than I originally thought, but it has taught me a lot. I haven't gotten stuck yet, which is good, but I have had to struggle a bit. The planning has been very useful so far, I have clearer idea what I need to do and how I will do them.

## Plan for the next day

Continue backend code, try to get basic backend working asap, so I can start the frontend production, wihout making another server. Revisit async/await usage in TypeScript for the sake of learning. Do more intermediate commits and do not get too excited and try to bite too much at once.
