# Day 3

## What did I accomplish? 

I finished adding users, logging in and adding datapoints and these are done with token authentication.

## What went well?

Frankly not many things today. I had success making api for adding datapoints after I had struggled with other apis.

## What went poorly?

Again TypeScript has proven to be more difficult than previously anticipated. But I have managed to solve my problems so far. I had quite a lot of problems with request and response types and also type checking. Fortunately I got everything sorted out somewhat. I need to revisit those parts later, since I had to ignore TypeScipt warnings due to not having typeguards. I have to add them later, I just want a basic working backend for now.

## Reflection

TypeScript is a demanding, but an effective teacher. I have learned a lot about TypeScript and JavaScript syntax, since one can't be lazy when writin TypeScript. I have learned a lot how to actually use TypeScript even with libraries that I haven't used with TypeScripy before, such as mongoose. Today has been a rough, but an educational day.

## Plan for the next day

Add basic way to fetch data, no parameters yet. Then start basics of FrontEnd code and maybe add basic tests to backend.
