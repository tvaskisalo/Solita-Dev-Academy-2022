# Day 7

## What did I accomplish? 

I made a lot of frondend code. I added more reducers for monthly data, statistics and metric data.

## What went well?

Honestly everything went really somoohtly. I had a very productive day and everything went well.

## What went poorly?

Only thing that was rough this day was finding a good library to draw graphs with. Once that was sorted, everything went pretty well.

## Reflection

I should have started making frontend more seriously a couple of days ago. Fortunately I have managed to do a lot today, so it has not been that big of an issue. It was nice to notice that backend has worked flawlessly today and it has done everything as expected, which gave me a good feeling.

## Plan for the next day

Finish and refactor frontend and add testing. Start writing README.
