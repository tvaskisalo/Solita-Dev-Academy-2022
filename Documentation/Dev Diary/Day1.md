# Day 1

## What did I accomplish? 

I made the first documentations for understanding and describing the given assignment. I made basic architecture modelling and technology desicions based on them. I also started structuring the repository and made plans how I will solve the assignment.

## What went well?

I think my reasoning for each technology is well justified and fitting for showing my own skills as a developer.

## What went poorly?

Nothing went particulary poorly and I didn't encounter major difficulties today. The biggest problem was dissecting the problem and dividing it into subproblems.

## Reflection

I am frankly excited for this project and I am looking forward to rehearsing my FullStack skills. I am prepared to do quite a lot of work for the assignment.

## Plan for the next day

Tomorrow I will continue the design of the software and start making basic structures for the fronend and backend. My goal is to ensure all the technologies I want to use will be used from the start. It will save me a lot of headache and restructuring in the future.
