# Day 4

## What did I accomplish? 

Today I focused on the frontend, I got basic login and logout functionality, form to add new datapoints with token authentication. I also started using redux for state management. I also studied how some ui-elemnents work.

## What went well?

This day went really well, frankly. I find frontend code overall a bit easier to code, compared to backend. I am really glad that I got redux working easily. I was also suprised how well I remembered how to get basic frontend working. 

## What went poorly?

I had problems with adding proxy to frontend package.json. Not sure why it does not work and I will figure it out later, if needed. Otherwise, I did not have other major hiccups today.

## Reflection

This day was a huge confidence boost. I felt a bit demoralized after my struggles with the backend. Today I took a look at my backend code and it was not nearly as bad as I thought. The frontend code has been easier to develop. 

## Plan for the next day

Continue frontend code and add ways to fetch data from the database in a meaningful way. Preferably start testing as well.
